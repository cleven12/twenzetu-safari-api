      "description": "Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park is Zanzibar's only national park, protecting 50 km² of the last remaining indigenous forest on Unguja Island. The park is the primary stronghold of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus kirkii), found nowhere else on Earth. Troops of these charismatic primates with their distinctive red caps and white tufted cheeks are commonly encountered along the forest trails. The park also shelters Sykes monkeys, bushbabies, Ader's duikers, and over 50 bird species. Forest transitions into mangrove ecosystems on the edge of Chwaka Bay with boardwalk trails offering a unique coastal ecology experience.",
