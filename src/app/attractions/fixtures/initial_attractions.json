Kilimanjaro is a bucket-list trekking destination offering five main routes (Machame, Marangu, Lemosho, Rongai, Umbwe), each with unique scenery through five distinct ecological zones: cultivated farmland, montane forest, heath and moorland, alpine desert, and the arctic summit.

The crater also shelters one of the few remaining black rhino populations in Tanzania.
